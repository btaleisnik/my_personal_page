## Brandon's personal page
#### May 27, 2014

## Overview

#### Motivation

-I want this page to show my unique personality, and also showcase some of my projects.
-Target audience is primarily friends and family, as I don't anticipate being able to create anything impressive enough to show employers for a while.
-This page is mostly just for fun.

#### Content

-"You just kinda gotta go with the flow"
-Make wave crash, turn to a deep blue and then continue
-I'd like to put a photo of myself, a glimpse into my  best project, short bio, contact info, drinkdrivers info, list of skills/languages I know or enjoy most, what type of programming I ultimately would like to do (mobile apps).

## Design

- I would like my page to be simple, and colorful yet classy. (Incorporate grey and dark blue like my 3/4 sleeve RVCA shirt)
-I'll use an image of myself, a screenshot of part of the code to one of my projects, drinkdrivers logo, and waves (if possible)
